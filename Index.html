  <h1>Site evaluation</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.frankdeboosere.be/home.php"><img class="displayed" src="https://www.jobat.be/uploadedImages/pictures/frank-deboosere.jpg" alt="Frank Deboosere" /></a></p>

  <h3>Which site is it?</h3>

      <p><a href="https://www.frankdeboosere.be/home.php">https://www.frankdeboosere.be</a> <br/>
        This is the personal website of <strong>Frank Deboosere</strong>.</p>

  <h3>Does it get regular updates?</h3>

      <p>The page has an automatic feed of Frank's Twitter and Facebook as well as the daily weather, which updates every day. <br />
      There is also a page about the <em>'bike diaries'</em>, which gets new entries a couple times a month.</p>

  <h3>How did we find it?</h3>

      <p>One of us already knew about it and told us that it was a really weird website.</p>

  <h3>Why does this website need an update/make-over?</h3>

      <p>Looks like a spam website, with the strange colours and overload of stuff on the homepage. <br />
        Because of this it's really hard to get a decent overview of the different pages.  </p>

  <h3>Is this website active on social media?</h3>

      <p>Yes, Frank is very active on both <strong>Twitter</strong> and <strong>Facebook</strong>, which is probably why the site gets a surprising amount of visitors every day. <br />
      Especially knowing how badly the site is set up.   </p>

  <h3>Top three things that should be changed.</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Header needs to get its own background color, so it stands out more and is easier to use. <br />
      The different pages and the order in which they're placed can use some major rethinking as well.  </li>
      <li>Change the entire colour scheme, because the black-white-blue does not work.   </li>
      <li>Most of the pages need to be rewritten, because it's difficult to find anything you're looking for. <br />
      A lot of the information gets lost due to the messy way every page is set up. </li>
    </ul>
